This project was just an excuse to start learning _Rust_, don't take it too seriously ^^

## Usage

You can simply run the main binary crate using _Cargo_ to start a game:

    cargo run

You can also launch a fully non interactive / random game for debugging purposes if needed:

    cargo run -- random
